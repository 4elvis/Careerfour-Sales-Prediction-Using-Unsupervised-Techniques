# Careerfour-Sales-Prediction-Using-Unsupervised-Techniques
A Study of Carrefour Marketing Strategies using Unsupervised Learning Techniques, Elvis Njoroge Week 14IP

Defining the question
Revenue streams of any shopping giant are dependent on the marketing strategies employed by the marketing department. Carrefour, an internationally owned retail has approached a data scientist seeking to identify the best marketing strategy. The strategy must also yield the best marketing style excluding total price including tax. The investigation has split into four parts. 

Specifying the Question
Unsupervised learning techniques will be used to predict the best marketing technique. The main objective targets an increase in sales.

Defining the metrics of success.
•	Effectively cleaning our dataset.
•	Performing extensive exploratory data analysis where applicable.
•	Applying Dimensionality Reduction.
•	Selecting our features.
•	Applying Association rules.
•	Detecting anomalies in our data

Recording the Experimental Design
After defining the question, the loaded datasets will be subjected to data cleaning. Exploratory Data Analysis will define the relationship between some variables. The first dataset will be used to investigate Dimensionally Reduction Techniques (PCA) and Feature selection. The second dataset will be used to compile Association Rules predicting customer behavior. They will also be used to identify commonly shopped items. The last and final dataset will be subjected to Anomaly Detection. 
Data Validity
The datasets have been compiled by Carrefour marketing team. Part 1 and 2 (http://bit.ly/CarreFourDataset, ) , Part 3, (http://bit.ly/SupermarketDatasetII ) and Part 4, (http://bit.ly/CarreFourSalesDataset ). 

Packages used
The project has used R programming Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning Packages.
